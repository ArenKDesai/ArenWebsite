<p>Hello! I'm a data scientist! I've mostly done machine learning, energy supply analysis, and some graphics and robotics. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Right now, I'm employed as an Energy Supply and Trading Intern at Madison Gas & Electric. </p>

I like leaving the details in the code --- more specifically, the GitHub repositories. Still, you can find some basic explanations of my projects in the links below.
