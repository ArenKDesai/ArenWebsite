### Locational Market Price (LMP) Forecasting
*Forecasting, Machine Learning (ML), LASSO Regression, Deep Neural Networks (DNN)*

A deep exploration of locational market price (LMP) data focused on Madison, WI. Multiple data sources were used and coordinated with data engineers to develop a [LEAR](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/8/621) and deep neural network (DNN) model that captures the spatiotemporal nature of LMP data, and allows for a 2-week forecast. This is used by Madison Gas & Electric's (MGE's) energy traders to maximize potential revenue.
