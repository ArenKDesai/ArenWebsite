I originally made this website so I could have a fun, unique resume. The idea was to have a Large Language Model reply to your messages, showing off my Google Cloud Platform and data science skills while being interesting and playful.

After I took a Graphics course, the goal started to shift. The animations started being more fun, and the fisher character was surprisingly satisfying to create. Most importantly, the reactions I would get when I showed people my animations were the most fun. I like showing off cool, interesting toys for people to mess with. The data science and LLM skills could wait for another project. 

Something strange happened after my first prototype. Some people would recommend ways to make the website easier to navigate, or feel more natural to the user. This should make sense to you; websites should feel natural and intuitive. But that's not why I made this website. 

I want my projects to make people think. From the amount of my website you've navigated so far, what have you thought about? Were you annoyed that you had to remember what you've searched and what you haven't? Did you think the fishing animation was impressive, or were you finding jitters you thought I could fix? Were you thinking of ways to make the website more intuitive?

I don't appreciate intuitive, natural websites for this reason, so forgive me if this one is a little annoying. My goal is to keep you thinking.
