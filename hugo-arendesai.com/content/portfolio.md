### Certifications

I'm currently preparing for the **Google Cloud Platform Professional Certification** exam. 

I also have a certification for **FICO DMP**. 

## Experience

From May 2024 to Now, I've been the Energy Supply and Trading Intern for Madison Gas & Electric, where I've been building **complex simulations of the MISO energy market** and **forecasting locational market prices (LMPs) for energy** in the Madison area with powerful ML/DL models like [temporal fusion transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363). 

From January 2023 to January 2024, I was the Data Analytics Intern for Compeer Financial, where I **built regression models and neural networks** to predict the probability that an agriculture loan would default or potentially default.
