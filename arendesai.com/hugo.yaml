          I am a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and energy market analyst who leverages powerful deep-learning tools to predict the movement of trades in the MISO and PJM grids. 

          I studied computer science and data science as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin Madison, where I was also the finance lead of the Google Developer Student Club and a member of the robotics team.
